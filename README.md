Problem Definition:

In our increasingly busy lives, individuals often struggle to efficiently manage their tasks and responsibilities. The human brain has limitations in remembering and organizing multiple tasks, leading to forgetfulness, missed deadlines, and increased stress levels. Traditional methods of managing tasks, such as paper to-do lists or mental notes, often prove inadequate in keeping up with the demands of modern life. As a result, there is a pressing need for a digital solution that can effectively organize, prioritize, and remind users of their tasks in a seamless and user-friendly manner.

This problem necessitates the development of a robust and intuitive digital to-do list application that addresses the following key challenges:

Task Organization: Users need a system that allows them to categorize and organize tasks based on various criteria such as priority, due date, project, or context.
Prioritization: With a multitude of tasks competing for attention, users require a mechanism to prioritize their tasks effectively, ensuring that critical tasks are completed in a timely manner.
Reminders and Notifications: To prevent tasks from slipping through the cracks, the application must offer timely reminders and notifications to alert users of upcoming deadlines or scheduled tasks.
Accessibility and Syncing: In today's interconnected world, users expect their to-do list to be accessible across multiple devices (e.g., smartphones, tablets, desktops) and synced in real-time to ensure consistency and continuity of task management.
User Interface and Experience: A user-friendly interface with intuitive navigation and seamless interactions is essential to encourage adoption and ensure that users can easily leverage the application's features without encountering unnecessary complexities.
By addressing these challenges, the development of an innovative digital to-do list application aims to empower users to take control of their tasks, increase productivity, reduce stress, and ultimately enhance their overall quality of life.<img width="248" alt="Screenshot 2024-04-04 at 16 17 50" src="https://github.com/mu-se373-220704017/todolist/assets/163428737/d66f5219-8711-4c4d-a53f-df4cf7f73600">
